    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>

    <p><strong>Dihydrogen monoxide</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxyl acid</em> or <em>DHMO</em><sup>1</sup>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>: is the major component of acid rain,<br>contributes to the greenhouse effect,<br>may cause severe burns,<br>is fatal if inhaled,<br>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,<br>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,<br>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,<br>and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</p>

    <p>Despite the danger, DHMO is often used: as an industrial solvent and coolant,<br>in nuclear power plants,<br>in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,<br>as a fire retardant,<br>in many forms of cruel animal research,<br>as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,<br>in the distribution of pesticides.<br>Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
